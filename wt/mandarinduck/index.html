        <p>Mandarin ducks were introduced to the UK most likely from China (while some other sources claim the Far East, including Japan, Korea and Russia), around the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00063658809476990">mid-18th century</a>, and then escaped captivity to become established. Their natural habitat includes woodlands and wetlands, and in the UK they're thought to mainly inhabit areas in South East England, North England, Wales and Scotland. In east Asian culture, the Mandarin duck commonly represents love, peace, fidelity (as they're believed to mate for life) and happy couples.

        In 2018, a singular Mandarin duck was spotted in New York City's Central Park - how it got there was unknown, and the duck quickly became a celebrity, receiving coverage from the BBC, New York Times, The Guardian, CNN, etc. In 2021, a children's book about the duck was released, and in 2023, a short documentary 'The Duck of New York' was also released
